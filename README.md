> ![In-progress Minesweeper Board](images/in%20progress.png)
> Created with Java and JavaFX



This was a fun little project that I did in order to understand JavaFX a bit more as well as to have experience in something other than the projects they gave us at school. My goal for this project was to have a Minesweeper clone that could do the following: 
- reveal empty areas
- flag tiles
- difficulty options
- the ability to play as many games as you wanted
- determine if you won/lost without having to flag all the mines

I was successful in achieving what I had set out to do and am happy to call this project finished. I was able to develop my skills in both programming and reading documentation as well as gaining more practice with tools that we touched upon in class.
